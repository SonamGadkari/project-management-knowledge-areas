### Information to be communicated, including format, content, and level of detail

The information related to the project is mainly collected through group and individual communication,emails,through productive meetings. We maintain confidentiality by giving access to documents to specific persons in git hub and JIRA. Not all can access the documents.

###  Who receives the information and who will produce it and when?

The primary communicator for project distribution information is the project manager. If there are any changes in the plan of the project and requirements according to the communication management plan project manager will be the main responsible person through the project. These changes are also discussed with project team and client by conducting formal meetings. Daily progress reports and pending task details are sent to the team lead, project manager and client through emails.


### Frequency of communication

Team meetings are held daily to know the daily status of the project and the work that need to be done for the day and weekly meeting are conducted with the stakeholders about the project status.

### Escalation procedures for resolving issues

The issues that are raised in JIRA project must be resolved in a systematic way by raising tickets and solving them based on the priority. Based on the priority, the incidents can be resolved.


### Revision procedures for updating the communications management plan

Communications management plan can be updated using collaborative tools like sharepoint, SVN and google tools like google docs, google slides, google calenders, google drive, google gmail, google sheets, and google sites.

### Production issues and resolution

There will be a closure or project if the issues are not resolved in the provided time frame. Proper reasons should be provided for delay in the issue resolutions.
