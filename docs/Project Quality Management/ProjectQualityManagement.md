## Quality Management:
Quality management is the process for ensuring that all project activities necessary to design, plan and implement a project are effective and efficient with respect to the purpose of the objective and its performance.
The goals for quality management are to assure Project deliverables meet their stated requirements and Project management processes are appropriately followed.
Quality management is performed throughout the project lifecycle with special attention to:
1.	Quality Planning – primarily during the project planning process.
2.	Quality Assurance  – primarily during the project execution process.
3.	Quality Control  – primarily during the project monitoring and controlling process.
4.	Verification and Validation – ideally performed in all project processes except initiation.

# quality Metrics: 
Quality metrics are a key component of an effective quality management plan and are the measurements used in ensuring customers receive acceptable products or deliverables.
Following are the metrics used to measure quality:
1. Passed Test Cases Percentage = (Number of Passed Tests/Total number of tests executed) * 100 
2. Failed Test Cases Percentage = (Number of Failed Tests/Total number of tests executed) * 100
3. Fixed Defects Percentage = (Defects Fixed/Total Defects Reported) * 100
4. Accepted Defects Percentage = (Defects Accepted as valid by team/Total defects reported)*100
5. Executed Tests or Test Execution Coverage Percentage=(Number of tests run/Total number of tests to be run)*100
6. Requirements Coverage = (Number of requirements covered/Total number of requirements)*100
7. Number of bugs per test = Total number of defects/Total number of tests
8. Number of tests run per time period = Number of tests run/Total time
9. Test design efficiency = Number of tests designed/Total time
10. Bug find rate = Total number of defects/Total number of test hours

| S No | Defect Level       | Defect Name                                | Measurements|
|------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | High-Level Defects | Not allocating work to individual, Planning errors                           | Project Manager should have a better than average data of the partners and their abilities and dole out work in like way|
| 2    | Mid-level Defects  | Bugs, Integration issues                                      | Exactly when modules are united together and attempted on a whole a couple issues may develop so the testing gathering should have enough learning of the extensive number of modules|                                          
| 3    | Low-level Defects  | Hard-disk specifications                         | Screen resolution of the PCs won't not be awesome which may not be a tremendous issue but instead work should be conceivable better if it is as per the particulars|

# Quality Tools:
The following are examples of tools that can be used to support quality management implementation
- Cost-Benefit Analysis: Compares the cost of the quality process to the expected benefit
- Control Charts : Used to determine if a process is stable or predictable, within limits
- Benchmarking : Compares current project processes to comparable projects 
- Design of Experiments : A statistical method to determine influential factors on a product or process
- Statistical Sampling : Choosing a representative sample from a population of interest for inspection
- Cost of Quality : Costs incurred for quality, includes cost of conformance and cost of non-conformance
- Six Sigma : Improves the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing causes of errors
- Quality Audits : Compliance with policies, standards, and processes
- Process Analysis : Planned continuous improvement of processes
